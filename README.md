# Pet Adopt

<<<<<<< HEAD
A SvelteKit + TypeScript web app that lets users browse, adopt, and care for puppies and kittens.  
All data is stored in JSON files under `static/data/`—no external database required.

   - Session persisted in `localStorage`

3. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)  
   - View your adopted pets  
   - Track hunger & happiness levels

   - **Return** (puts pet back and gives \$20 refund)
